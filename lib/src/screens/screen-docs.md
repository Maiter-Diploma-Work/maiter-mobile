   - User and Search Event — The screens that represent the views dedicated to find a user according to filters and algorithms the app (would) use
   - Matches — screens that shows the mutual likes and whether current user allowed to attend some sor of event
 - Chat — A built in chatting application with some basic functionality (sending messages, answering, and sending files). Because this app is not really about messaging — it will be minimal
