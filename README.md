# Amica

_Amica is an App that suppose to connect people with same interests in the area_

## About Project

This project originally were meant as a clone of dating app like Tinder, Badoo and others

For now there is only the mobile version

Amica also were meant to me, as it's developer, as a playground where I could learn about flutter -
amazing framework to create mobile apps, that has huge potential and future, as I think. I wanted to
learn Flutter and Dart on practice, and so **practice I did**

## Goals of Project

  solid portfolio-project for me and my two friends (Designer and Backender)
