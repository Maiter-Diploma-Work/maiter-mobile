# Amica

_Amica is an App that suppose to connect people with same interests in the area_

## About Project

This project originally were meant as a clone of dating app like Tinder, Badoo and others

For now there is only the mobile version

Amica also were meant to me, as it's developer, as a playground where I could learn about flutter -
amazing framework to create mobile apps, that has huge potential and future, as I think. I wanted to
learn Flutter and Dart on practice, and so **practice I did**

## Goals of Project

- Main goal was to create an application to imitate famous dating apps for the sake of creating a
  solid portfolio-project for me and my two friends (Designer and Backender)
- Practice and self-discipline
- Learn Flutter
- Enjoy the development process

## Functionality

As the purpose suggest this app has some functionality to make the following (
***The backend part is not yet done***)

- [ ] Searching for people in certain area
- [ ] Matching (when two people like each other in the search)
- [ ] Basic chatting experience for Matches
- [ ] User profile editing

The more specific and unique features of the app is supposed to be:

- [x] Creating and searching for events that users create (Event in this context is a meeting in the
  real world)
- [ ] Subscribing for events
- [ ] Invitation for events

And more basic functionality

- [x] Authorization + Authentication
- [x] CRUD'S for profiles
- [ ] CRUD'S for events
- [ ] CRUD'S for chat messages

## Suggestions

This project needs a lot of refactoring, and time to be ready, such projects does not release
by only one person in a span of 6 months with a decent quality

As for me this one is still raw, especially backend (－‸ლ). There is till lots of room for
improvement

Here is some things I could suggest to improve this project further:

- [ ] Tabs for chat to identify who is who and how they were connected (Either by subscribing to
  event or by match)
- [ ] Push notifications
- [ ] Match notifications
- [ ] Rework toolbar to look more interesting like the following: ![app_bar_image_2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20201029125034/HowtoAddaFloatingActionButtontoBottomNavigationBarinAndroid.png)
- [ ] It would be nice to add animations
- [ ] Of course it is always nice to have a #*!@ing backend to process data on remote device. This could be done in three months, but something went wrong 
- [ ] It would be nice to have a dedicated page to edit events, remove them, etc
- [ ] A system to pin chats, as were suggested by Andriy (The designer)
- [ ] Somehow manage user's social networks, and add them in registration
- [ ] Somehow manage user images, idk, like upload them, store, and get, delete and so on
- List is yet to be completed, but I asserted my point
